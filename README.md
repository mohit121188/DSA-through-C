<b><ins>STACK</ins></b>
  <br><b>Note: Stack is implemented using array in all the given below programs(Program no.1 to program no. 10)</b>
  <br><b>Program 1:</b> push and pop operation on the stack
  <br><b>Program 2:</b> program to reverse a string using stack.
  <br><b>Program 3:</b> program which takes a valid postfix expression as input then calculates the final evaluated value of this postfix expression using stack.Assumption:- here user will enter postfix expression with single digit operand only and maximum length of postfix expression is 29*/
  <br><b>Program 4:</b>program which takes a valid prefix expression as input then calculates the final evaluated value of this prefix expression using stack.
Assumption:- here user will enter prefix expression with single digit operand only and maximum length of the prefix expression can be 29
<br><b>Program 5:</b>program to convert an infix expression into the postfix expression using stack. Assumption:- user will enter a valid infix expression, each operand either can be an alphabate or can be a single digit only, infix expression does not contain any parenthesis.
<br><b>Program 6:</b>program in C to convert an infix expression into the prefix expression using stack. Assumption: user will enter a valid infix expression, each operand either can be an alphabate or can be a single digit only, infix expression does not contain any parenthesis
<br><b>Program 7:</b>convert infix expression into postfix expression. Assumption:- user will input valid infix expression only, and 
each operand can be either a single digit or a single alphbate. note: user can enter infix expression containing parenthesis also.
<br><b>Program 8:</b>infix to prefix conversion. assumptions: user will enter valid infix expression only, max length of operand can be single digit or single
alphabet, parenthesis are also allowed in the infix expression
<br><b>Program 9:</b>Given a string containing parentheses (e.g., "(()())"), determine whether the parentheses are balanced or not.
<br><b>Program 10:</b>Next greater element: Given an array, for each element, find the next greater element in the array
(e.g., for the array [4, 5, 2, 25], the next greater element for 4 is 5, for 5 is 25, for 2 is 25,
 and for 25 there is no greater element).
 <br><br><b>Note: Stack is implemented using singly linked list in all the given below programs</b>
 <br><b>Program 11:</b>Program to implement a stack, perfrom push,pop,isempty,peek operation.
 
<br><br>
<b><ins>LINEAR AND CIRCULAR QUEUE</ins></b>
<br><b>Note : Linear and circular Queue are implemented using array in given below programs.</b>
<br><b>Program 1:</b>Program to implement a linear queue.
<br><b>Program 2:</b>Implement enqueue and dequeue operation on circular queue of max size 5.
<br><b>Program 3:</b>Write a C program to count the number of elements in a Linear queue.
<br><b>Program 4:</b>Write a C program to count the number of elements in a Circular queue.
<br><b>Program 5:</b>Write a C program to reverse the elements of a linear queue. containing integer elements assumption: max size of linear queue 5.
<br><b>Program 6:</b>Write a C Program to reverse a circular queue
<br><b>Program 7:</b>Write a C program to calculate the sum of the elements in a linear queue, after calculating sum original queue must not be disturbed
<br><b>Program 8:</b>Write a C program to calculate the sum of the elements in a circular queue, after calculating sum original queue must not be disturbed.
<br><b>Program 9:</b>Write a C program to find the largest element and smallest element in the linear queue
<br><br>
<b><ins>SINGLY LINKED LIST</ins></b>
<br><b>Program 1:</b> Write a user interactive menu driven program C program to implement a singly linked list program, which can perform following operations: 
                     <br>(1)insert data at end
                     <br>(2)delete data from end
                     <br>(3)insert data at beginning
                     <br>(4)delete data from beginning
                     <br>(5)insert data at a specific position
                     <br>(6)delete data from a specific position
                     <br>(7)search the position of a node on the basis of key data value
                     <br>(8)find and replace
                     <br>(9)display the list

                     <br>(11)reverse the list
                     <br>(12)remove duplicate elements from the list
                     <br>(13)remove nodes having a specific key value from the list
                     <br>(14)largest value in the linked list
                     <br>(15)smallest value in the linked list
                     <br>(16)find nth node from the begining
