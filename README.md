<b>STACK</b>
  <br><b>Program 1:</b> implement push and pop operation on the stack
  <br><b>Program 2:</b> program to reverse a string using stack.
  <br><b>Program 3:</b> program which takes a valid postfix expression as input then calculates the final evaluated value of this postfix expression using stack.Assumption:- here user will enter postfix expression with single digit operand only and maximum length of postfix expression is 29*/
  <br><b>Program 4:</b>program which takes a valid prefix expression as input then calculates the final evaluated value of this prefix expression using stack.
Assumption:- here user will enter prefix expression with single digit operand only and maximum length of the prefix expression can be 29
<br><b>Program 5:</b>program to convert an infix expression into the postfix expression using stack. Assumption:- user will enter a valid infix expression, each operand either can be an alphabate or can be a single digit only, infix expression does not contain any parenthesis.
<br><b>Program 6:</b>program in C to convert an infix expression into the prefix expression using stack. Assumption: user will enter a valid infix expression, each operand either can be an alphabate or can be a single digit only, infix expression does not contain any parenthesis
